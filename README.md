This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React redux course, developed by [React Training](https://reacttraining.com). The goal of this project is to demonstrate the skills learned during the course, an API project using node.js has been provided as the backend of the application, without any of the React code that is needed to complete the project.

## Changes

- API has been modified with some minor changes in structure and data.
- Webpack has been configured (without using create react app)
- webpack-hot-middleware
- One module server only, the server renders a view that contains the bundle file
- Implemented [pureCSS](https://purecss.io/) as css framework
- Multi user application (users are hardcoded)

## Installation

This project requires node and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to run, once in the root folder of the application you have to do:

```sh
npm install
```

```sh
npm start
```
```sh
This application runs on port 3001 (http://localhost:3001)
```


### Get Started Immediately

You **don’t** need to install or configure tools like Webpack or Babel.<br>
They are preconfigured so you can focus on running the application.

**You’ll need to have Node >= 6 on your machine**. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) to easily switch Node versions between different projects.

**The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the skills learned during the training**
